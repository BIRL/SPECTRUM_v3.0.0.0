Mass spectrometry (MS)-based top-down proteomics (TDP) offers intact protein analysis towards a comprehensive characterization of proteoforms. However, ion losses during MS/MS fragmentation limit the efficiency of TDP search pipelines and make spectral interpretation challenging. In this work, we report a novel de novo-based complementary ion search (COINS) algorithm that estimates unreported complementary ions in TDP spectral data followed by their incorporation into the search process to augment proteoform characterization. Results from our experiments show that COINS significantly enhances top-down proteoform search performance. To evaluate the performance of COINS, we have developed three case studies using published datasets. In that, COINS reported 86% more proteoforms along with a 98% improvement in proteoform spectral matches (PrSMs) count at 1% FDR, using an Escherichia coli dataset. Alongside, a 1.8 folds increase was also observed in unique proteoforms count. In terms of peptide sequence tags (PSTs), up to 3.6 folds improvement was also observed. The second case study which aimed to evaluate the performance of COINS on post-translational modifications (PTMs) identification rate, a HeLa spectral dataset was searched and reported ~14% more PTMs. The third case study involved searching a Carbonic Anhydrase 2 (CA2) dataset that was produced using multiple fragmentation methods. COINS exhibited a 9% improvement in PrSMs, up to 43% increase in PSTs, along with a 1.5 folds improvement in PTMs count. Taken together, COINS enhanced de novo PST search along with proteoform spectral matches, which in tandem can provide significantly enhanced proteoform identification rates in TDP.
